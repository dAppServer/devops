# Sponsors

Both Sponsors have free public access; meaning you are more than welcome to fork and use for yourself, for commercial projects, they have options for you too. 

## Build systems: Docker Inc
Docker Inc sponsor us with Opensource access, meaning the opensource community can leverage their very generous sponsorship, without affecting their personal quotas. 

With docker, Opensource developers have access to "pull and play" build environments, for any playform. <3 TY Docker

## Secure Build Environments: Kasm Workspaces 

With our concurrent licence sponsorship from [Kasm Workspaces](https://www.kasmweb.com/); we can not only test applications,
using [SANS SIFT Workstation](https://www.sans.org/tools/sift-workstation/);

We can build other OpenSource projects we partner / sponsor, so we can stand behind the code that produced a binary with fingerprint X; recorded in git, with its result in public domain.
