# Setting up a local development environment

## Grab a developer checkout

We have a script to download all the code in the project structure on GitLab

[clone-projects-develop.sh](https://gitlab.com/lthn.io/resources/-/blob/master/clone-projects-develop.sh)

Or just run it below 

```shell
wget -O - https://gitlab.com/lthn.io/resources/-/raw/master/clone-projects-develop.sh | bash
```
